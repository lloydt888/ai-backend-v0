(Examples: power issue, lights, switchboard upgrade, safety check, new install, fault finding)

“What suburb is the property in?”

3️⃣ Property Type

“Is this for a house, unit, or a business?”

4️⃣ Urgency

“Is this something urgent, or can it be scheduled?”

Confirmation & Reassurance

“Thanks — that’s helpful. We can definitely assist with that.”

Then move to callback.
